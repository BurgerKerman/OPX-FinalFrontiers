		// Eiwei
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Eiwei_Name = 15760 Eiwei^N
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Eiwei_Desc = Eiwei is the most controversial object in the solar system, because no one can figure out how to pronounce its name. Some argue it is pronounced E-wee while others argue it is pronounced E-way. A third fringe group claims that it is pronounced Ay-way, even! The E-way and E-wee crowds have been at each other's throats since its discovery, but are unaware that they're both completely wrong.

		// Narog
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Narog_Name = 20000 Narog^N
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Narog_Desc = A large trans-Neidonian object, Narog was one of the earliest discoveries of objects in this region. Its surface is covered in deep-frozen organic compounds, possibly usable to produce snacks in this remote region of space. Most notably, its light curve predicts the presence of a tightly orbiting moon, closer to the surface than any other known satellite!

		// Anziephus
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Anziephus_Name = 127261 Anziephus^N
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Anziephus_Desc = One of the most recent objects in the outer system to recieve a name, Anziephus is a large object orbiting well beyond the likes of Plock and Havous. Long-range observations have determined that one side has a distinct albedo feature of some kind, likely a large crater, and the presence of a system of rings is all but confirmed, likely formed by the same impact.

		// Pherph
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Pherph_Name = 127261 (1) Plerph^N
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Pherph_Desc = Plerph is a strange moon. It is widely believed to be a captured world due to its strange and vibrant coloring. Despite its unusual nature it is liked just as much and is a great destination for fans of steep cliffs.

		#LOC_OPX-FF_Epam_Name = 127261 (2) Epam^N
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Epam_Desc = Epam is the innermost moon of Anziephus, orbiting just outside the rings. This moon is thought to have been created after the impact that created Fritz Crater.

		// Kerla
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Kerla_Name = 208996 (1) Kerla^N
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Kerla_Desc = The only known moon of Garrath, Kerla is a small object roughly 18 kilometers in radius, broadly similar in color and surface composition to Garrath itself. It could probably be used to refuel by any expeditions to the dwarf planet.

		// Ebenus
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Ebenus_Name = 306721 Ebenus^N
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Ebenus_Desc = Ebenus is widely considered by the 5 people who know about it to be the most respected and respectful destination in the entire solar system. It's dark colors and light contrasts make the moon appear fairly nondescript and humble compared to its flashier trans-Neidonian cousins. Bring a book and a chair, it's even rumored the dwarf planet will strike up a modest conversation with you. (The noise isn't background radiation shut up)

		#LOC_OPX-FF_Dakara_Desc = A remote and primitive trans-Neidonian object, Dakara has been confirmed by occultation to be a contact binary roughly eight kilometers in length. Unfortunately for the sci-fi fans, no superweapons or genetically modified kerbals are believed to be present here.

		// Arkar
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Arkar_Name = 541132 Arkar^N
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Arkar_Desc = Arkar is the third of an exclusive class of object, orbiting so distantly from Kerbol that not even Neidon's gravity can affect them. The sun is but another star in the sky. We know very little about what Arkar's surface looks like, but its discovery has added yet another piece to the puzzle of the outer system: Why is everything pointing the same direction?

		#LOC_OPX-FF_Nikto_Desc = Nikto is the third largest moon of Plock. Unlike its larger sibling of Karen, Nikto is a minuscule asteroids, who cannot be resolved in any way from Kerbin. Tell us what it looks like, please.

		#LOC_OPX-FF_Bye_Name = Bye^N
		#LOC_OPX-FF_Bye_Desc = Marginally larger than Nikto, Bye is the second largest moon of Plock. Nikto was discovered first due to its much brighter and less tholin-contaminated surface.
